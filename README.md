# Currency Conversion

## Android development

 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * Uses [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html)
 * Uses many of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/): Room, LiveData and Lifecycle
 * Uses [koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for dependency injection
 
## Access Key
 
1. Sign up on [Currencylayer](https://currencylayer.com/) and get the access key.
2. Add the key in `local.properties` file like,
```
accessKey="42346b23493229dfsdf2***********"
```

## Build Environment

 * `debug`: Pure offline environment (not sending any Http requests to Remote) with build-in (fake) data.
 * `release`: Connecting the remote service with the access key in Free plan. It might hit no usage quota if use too many times.

## Architecture

Inspired by Clean Architecture, with using Dependency Injection, Kotlin Flow, and Androidx Room. 
 * `data`: Data layer, where includes Remote service and Local cache handed data by DAO class.
 * `domain`: Folder for Business Logic Components (Blocs) where isolates presentation and data layer.
 * `ui`: All presentation views and view controllers here within the folders.
 
## Persistent data

 * Database schemas

```
currency(
  id    text Primary Key,
  name  text 
)

currency_rate(
  id                int Primary Key,
  from_currency_id  text,
  to_currency_id    text,
  rate              float 
)

// join currency_rate and currency
CurrencyRateWithCurrency(
  id                int,
  from_currency_id  text,
  to_currency_id    text,
  rate              float,
  from_id           text,
  from_name         text,
  to_id             text,
  to_name           text 
)
```

 * Share Preference
 - `selected_currency`: store the selected country ID
 - `last_amount`: store the last amount

 
 
## Test code

Focus on testing Domain layer's Blocs, verifying the requests from views until fetch data if the logic is correct.
